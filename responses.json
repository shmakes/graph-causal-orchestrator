  "churn_why_customer": "Customer 0004-TLHLJ appears to churn because the causal graph links risk drivers like month-to-month contract terms and weak retention offers to churn outcomes. A practical intervention is to target this segment with longer-term incentives and proactive support. This is a hypothesis from graph structure and should be treated with caveats about unobserved confounders.",
  "churn_why_contract": "Month-to-month contracts are associated with churn in this dataset, and the causal overlay suggests a mechanism where low commitment increases sensitivity to price and service friction. Recommended intervention: prioritize contract-upgrade offers with value protection. Uncertainty remains because other factors (for example service quality and local competition) may confound the relationship.",
  "churn_counterfactual": "If we change offers for high-risk users, expected churn should decrease for cohorts where offer-related nodes sit on short causal paths to churn outcomes. Rank interventions by expected effect score and start with customers on month-to-month plans without meaningful discounts. This is an estimated directional effect, not a guaranteed causal magnitude."
