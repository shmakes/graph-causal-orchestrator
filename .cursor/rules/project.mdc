# Graph Causal Orchestrator

- Use Neo4j for graph storage; Cypher for queries and causal paths.
- Causal layer: causal_kg for edges, interventions, explanations.
- Orchestration: LangGraph workflows (single/multi-agent); optional AutoGen.
- Specs: YAML investigation specs in specs/examples/; parser loads them into Python.
- All code should run inside Cursor; env from .env via pydantic-settings.
